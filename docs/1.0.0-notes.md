# First round of testing 
- When a recipe is ready to start brewing on the homepage, if there's enough text it fills right up to the edge. We need to add some padding around this section to ensure we don't hit the edges.
- When a recipe is ready to start brewing but we have not yet started it, we should hide the 'up next' section and just display the same gap as if there is no 'up next' like when we're on the last recipe step.
- As a rule, when we're creating new recipes and new recipe steps, and also entering the profile name and bio, we should be capitalising the first letter of the entered string. I keep having to capitalise it through the keyboard which is bad UX. 
- When entering a new recipe, the coffee/water and unit selection didn't appear. This only appears on the 'edit recipe' bottom sheet. We need to add this in for when we're creating a new recipe. 
- If we could change the 'trash' icon for deleting a recipe/recipe step to be an outlined icon that would look better. 
- On the recipe detail page, the floating action button covers up the final step's delete button. Perhaps having the edit and delete buttons on the list aren't actually corrent here. Is it possible to implement a swipe to delete and a tap to edit? This would need actioning for the recipe page and the recipe detail page.
